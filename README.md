# Natural Computing: Final project

## Applying EA to L-Systems

...

To run a simulation run the `src/main.py file`.

- To change the parameters of the run, you only need to change the values in the parameters dictionary.  
- If you want to change the goal system you may change the settings of the goal LSystem.

Unfortunately, we did not find the time to provide a requirements.txt with the packages you need to be able to import all the packages yet.
